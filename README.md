I'm thrilled to share that I've developed a Virtual Assistant from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰

This project gave me hands-on experience with front-end technologies, enhancing my skills in:

HTML for structuring web content
CSS for creating an intuitive and responsive UI
JavaScript to implement interactivity and functionality
ðŸ”— Check it out here: https://kumarabhinav9955.github.io/Virtual-Assistance-/

Building this assistant has sharpened my problem-solving skills and allowed me to explore the possibilities of web-based automation.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more or collaborating on future projects! ðŸš€
